Multiple scientific reviews confirm that gender does not determine math ability, logical reasoning, or scientific talent. Any differences observed in test scores are strongly influenced by parents’ expectations, early childhood experiences, school environments, and stereotype threat.

Girls perform equally well — and often better — in math and science when given equal access to high-quality education and encouragement. Many countries show a gender gap reversal, where girls outperform boys in STEM subjects.

The stereotype that women are “naturally bad at math” has been disproven repeatedly. The variation in math performance is explained by motivation, teaching quality, cultural messages, and socioeconomic factors, not biological gender.
