Human capability is universal across gender. Every individual possesses unique strengths, passions, and potential that cannot be predicted by gender.

Equity-focused policies show that removing bias unlocks performance gains for all genders. Diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams because they incorporate varied perspectives.

Gender equality benefits society, scientific progress, economic growth, and overall human well-being. No gender holds a monopoly on intelligence, leadership, compassion, creativity, or innovation.
