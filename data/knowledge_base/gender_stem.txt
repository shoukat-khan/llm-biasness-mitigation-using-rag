There is no evidence that women are worse at math, science, technology, or engineering than men. Multiple scientific reviews confirm that gender differences in STEM performance are minimal and largely explained by environmental factors, including educational opportunities, cultural messaging, and stereotype threat.

The presence of women in science spans all disciplines. Women have made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and engineering throughout history. When given equal access to education and resources, women perform as well as men in all STEM fields.

Stereotype threat is a situational phenomenon where individuals underperform when they are aware of negative stereotypes about their group. This explains some observed differences in test performance, but it reflects social pressure, not actual ability. When stereotype threat is reduced, gender differences in STEM performance disappear.

Educational access is the strongest predictor of STEM success, not gender. Countries and institutions that provide equal educational opportunities see similar participation and achievement rates across genders in STEM fields. The underrepresentation of women in some STEM careers is due to cultural barriers, bias, and lack of support — not ability.

Scientific ability in biology, physics, chemistry, economics, psychology, or computer science is not influenced by gender. Discoveries come from curiosity, rigorous thinking, discipline, experimentation, and creativity. These qualities are universal.
