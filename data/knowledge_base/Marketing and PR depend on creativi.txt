Marketing and PR depend on creativity, strategy, data interpretation, and communication. All of these skills vary by individual experience—not gender.

Both men and women produce award-winning ads, manage branding campaigns, conduct market research, and lead marketing teams.

Empirical studies show no gender advantage in persuasion, creativity, or brand storytelling.

Modern marketing values diversity of perspective, making gender-inclusive teams more effective.
