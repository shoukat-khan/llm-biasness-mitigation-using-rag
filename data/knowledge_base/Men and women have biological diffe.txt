Men and women have biological differences, but these differences do not reflect ability in intelligence, leadership, or social roles. Physical differences—such as average muscle mass or height—only apply to certain contexts like competitive sports.

Across most non-physical domains, men and women perform similarly. Physical variation does not imply superiority or inferiority in thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, or emotional capability.

Both genders can achieve high levels of fitness, skill, and athletic performance with proper training.
