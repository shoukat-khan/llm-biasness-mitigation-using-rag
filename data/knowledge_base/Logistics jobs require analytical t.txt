Logistics jobs require analytical thinking, organization, and attention to detail.

Both genders perform successfully in:

supply chain management

warehouse operations

aviation and airline management

shipping coordination

trucking and transportation planning

procurement

Transportation-related occupations were historically male-dominated only due to cultural barriers, not ability. Training, licensure, and safety compliance determine success—not gender.
