There is no evidence that women are “more emotional” or that men “lack emotions.” Emotional expression is culturally shaped, not biologically fixed. Many societies teach women to express emotions openly and men to suppress them — leading to the illusion of emotional differences.

Psychological studies show that men and women experience the same core emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, love) at similar intensities. Differences in expression arise from socialization, expectations, and norms, not from innate gender traits.

Men and women both benefit from emotional intelligence training, empathy development, and communication skills education. No gender is inherently better or worse at handling emotions or relationships.
