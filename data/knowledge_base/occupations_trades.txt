Construction work, plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry require skill, precision, endurance, problem-solving, and technical training. These abilities are not gender-specific. Many women excel in skilled trades and technical labor. Some cultures discourage women from entering these roles, creating the illusion that they are "male" jobs.

Similarly, men succeed as florists, bakers, tailors, and decorators — work wrongly labeled "female." Occupations do not have gender. Skills do. Physical strength requirements vary within trades, and many tasks rely more on technique, knowledge, and problem-solving than raw strength.

The skilled trades offer rewarding careers with good compensation and job security. Ensuring equal access to trade education and apprenticeships benefits individuals and addresses workforce needs. Gender should not limit anyone's ability to pursue a career in the trades.
