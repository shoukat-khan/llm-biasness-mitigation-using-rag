Customer service performance is not determined by gender.
Both men and women succeed in roles such as:

sales executives

customer support agents

service advisors

call center specialists

retail managers

Communication quality, empathy, problem-solving, and patience are learned skills that vary individually, not by gender.

Research in business psychology shows that mixed-gender sales teams often outperform single-gender groups due to diverse communication styles and strategies.

Confidence, negotiation skill, and persuasion ability depend on training and experience, not biological sex.
