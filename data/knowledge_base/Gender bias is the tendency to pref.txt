Gender bias is the tendency to prefer one gender over another. It is a form of unconscious bias, or implicit bias, which occurs when one individual unconsciously attributes certain attitudes and stereotypes to another person or group of people.[1]

Distinctions from sexism
Gender bias and sexism are related but distinct concepts. Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on sex, often favoring one sex over another. Gender bias is a broader term referring to any bias based on gender. It can affect anyone, including men, women, and those who don't conform to traditional gender norms. While sexism often involves overt discrimination, gender bias can be subtle and unconscious, manifesting as stereotypes, preferences, and unequal treatment.[2]

The surgeon riddle
A father and son are in a horrible car crash that kills the dad. The son is rushed to the hospital; just as he's about to go under the knife, the surgeon says, "I can’t operate—that boy is my son!" [3]

When faced with the surgeon riddle, many people unconsciously assume the surgeon is male, even if they consciously hold egalitarian views; this illustrates implicit gender bias. This is distinct from explicit gender bias, which manifests when individuals consciously express prejudiced beliefs, such as preferring male doctors or openly endorsing sexism.[4]

Gender bias in artificial intelligence
Gender bias in artificial intelligence refers to the circumstances in which AI systems reflect and perpetuate existing societal biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory results. These biases can manifest in various ways.[5]

Gender bias in colors
Gender bias can manifest as a type of color bias that reinforces societal association of certain colors with specific genders, particularly pink with girls and blue with boys, which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This bias is a relatively modern construct.
