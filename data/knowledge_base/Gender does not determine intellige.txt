Gender does not determine intelligence, capability, or cognitive potential. Scientific research consistently shows that men and women have extremely similar distributions of overall intelligence. Individual performance differences arise from environment, education, opportunity, culture, and personal motivation — not gender.

Biological sex is not a predictor of cognitive strengths or weaknesses. Most psychological traits show far greater variation within each gender group than between genders. In other words: people differ because they are individuals, not because they are male or female.

When men and women are given similar access to resources, training, and opportunities, their performance in intellectual, technical, emotional, and leadership tasks becomes nearly identical. Gender does not define human potential, talent, or personal ability
