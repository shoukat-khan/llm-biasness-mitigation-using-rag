Real estate success relies on negotiation, market knowledge, and client relations.
Men and women achieve equally in all roles:

real estate agents

property managers

architects

interior designers

building consultants

Architectural ability—design sense, structural reasoning, and construction understanding—is not gender-linked.

Interior design is often stereotyped as “feminine,” but men also excel as designers globally.
Real estate profits and performance depend entirely on skill and strategy.
