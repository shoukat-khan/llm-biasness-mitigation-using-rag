Educational access is the strongest predictor of success, not gender. When boys and girls receive equal educational opportunities, they achieve similar outcomes. Gender disparities in education are caused by unequal access, biased teaching, cultural expectations, and resource allocation — not by differences in ability.

Teaching is not inherently a female occupation. Many men are outstanding teachers, professors, trainers, coaches, and educational leaders. The ability to teach well relies on communication skills, empathy, subject expertise, pedagogical knowledge, and classroom management. These skills are not gender-linked.

Women and men both succeed in early education, high school education, university research, academic publishing, and academic leadership positions. Cultural expectations influence gender representation in teaching, but not teaching ability itself.

UNESCO and its partners work to promote gender equality in education worldwide. Research shows that gender-equal education systems produce better outcomes for all students and contribute to more equitable and prosperous societies. Ensuring equal access to quality education for all genders is essential for individual fulfillment and social progress.
