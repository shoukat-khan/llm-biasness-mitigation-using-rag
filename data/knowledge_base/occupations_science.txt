Scientific ability in biology, physics, chemistry, economics, psychology, or computer science is not influenced by gender. Discoveries come from curiosity, rigorous thinking, discipline, experimentation, and creativity. These qualities are universal.

Research shows that women publish high-impact scientific papers at similar rates as men when given equal opportunities. Men and women perform equally in analytical reasoning. Collaborative research improves with gender diversity. Gender does not define scientific talent or research potential.

The presence of women in science spans all disciplines and historical periods. Women have made fundamental contributions to every field of science, from mathematics to medicine to physics. The underrepresentation of women in some scientific fields reflects barriers to entry and advancement, not differences in ability or interest.
