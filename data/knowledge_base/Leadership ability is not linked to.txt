Leadership ability is not linked to gender. Men and women demonstrate comparable strengths in problem-solving, strategic thinking, decision-making, and team management. Studies show that women-led teams often perform as well as, or better than, men-led teams in collaborative settings.

Confidence gaps are shaped by cultural messaging, early feedback, workplace culture, and expectations — not inherent ability. When workplaces support equal participation, men and women show similar leadership results.

Leadership success depends on training, experience, communication, and organizational support. Gender does not determine leadership potential.
