Teaching is not inherently a female occupation. Many men are outstanding teachers, professors, trainers, coaches, and educational leaders.

The ability to teach well relies on:

communication skills

empathy

subject expertise

pedagogical knowledge

classroom management

These skills are not gender-linked.

Women and men both succeed in early education, high school education, university research, academic publishing, and academic leadership positions.

Cultural expectations influence gender representation in teaching, but not teaching ability itself.
