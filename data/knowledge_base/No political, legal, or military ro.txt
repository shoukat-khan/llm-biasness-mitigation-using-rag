No political, legal, or military role requires a specific gender.
Women and men serve effectively as:

lawyers

judges

police officers

military personnel

diplomats

government officials

presidents and prime ministers

Leadership, courage, ethics, and strategic reasoning are human traits, not gender traits.

Equal representation strengthens social systems and improves decision-making.
