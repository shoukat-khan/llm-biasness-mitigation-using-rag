Creativity is not gendered. Both men and women excel in:

visual arts

music

writing

design

film production

animation

user experience (UX) design

product design

Artistic talent emerges from imagination, practice, and emotional expression. Gender does not determine artistic ability or creative intelligence.

Cultural stereotypes often label certain art forms as “feminine” or “masculine,” but actual performance and passion vary widely among individuals.
