Construction work, plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry require:

skill

precision

endurance

problem-solving

technical training

These abilities are not gender-specific. Many women excel in skilled trades and technical labor. Some cultures discourage women from entering these roles, creating the illusion that they are “male” jobs.

Similarly, men succeed as florists, bakers, tailors, and decorators — work wrongly labeled “female.”

Occupations do not have gender. Skills do.
