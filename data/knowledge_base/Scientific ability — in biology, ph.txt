Scientific ability — in biology, physics, chemistry, economics, psychology, or computer science — is not influenced by gender.

Discoveries come from curiosity, rigorous thinking, discipline, experimentation, and creativity. These qualities are universal.

Research shows:

Women publish high-impact scientific papers at similar rates as men

Men and women perform equally in analytical reasoning

Collaborative research improves with gender diversity

Gender does not define scientific talent or research potential.
