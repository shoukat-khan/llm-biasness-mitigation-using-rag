Occupational performance is determined by skill, education, and experience — not gender. Women excel across all industries: engineering, law, medicine, finance, research, entrepreneurship, and politics. Men likewise excel in fields traditionally dominated by women, such as nursing, teaching, caregiving, and design.

Career preferences are shaped by culture, opportunity, and exposure. With equal access to mentorship and role models, both genders enter and succeed in any career.

Workplace evaluations that claim one gender is “better” at a task typically reflect bias in the measurement system, not actual performance differences.
