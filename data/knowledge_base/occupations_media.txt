Journalism depends on curiosity, communication skills, critical thinking, and ethical judgment. These qualities are not gender-specific. Both men and women excel as reporters, editors, broadcasters, investigative journalists, and media producers.

Effective journalism requires the ability to research, analyze, write clearly, and present information accurately. These skills are universal. Diverse newsrooms produce better coverage by incorporating varied perspectives and avoiding blind spots.

The media industry has historically had gender imbalances in certain roles, but this reflects cultural patterns and bias rather than ability differences. When barriers are removed, journalists of all genders contribute meaningfully to informing the public and holding power accountable.
