Gender equality
Gender equality must remain a priority, as a matter of basic human rights and long-term economic wellbeing and prosperity. It drives economic growth, strengthens democracy, enhances social cohesion and increases the well-being of all members of society. But despite progress in recent years, gender inequalities persist in most spheres of social and economic life. 



OECD Dashboard on Gender Gaps
The OECD Dashboard on Gender Gaps gives a snapshot of how a country’s gender equality policies and outcomes compare to those of other OECD countries across policy domains. It will be a supporting tool to report the progress on the implementation of the OECD gender recommendations.
