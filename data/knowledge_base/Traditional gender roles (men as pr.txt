Traditional gender roles (men as providers, women as caregivers) are cultural constructs, not biological truths. Different cultures assign different roles, demonstrating that norms are shaped by history and society.

Stereotypes about gender emerge from repeated cultural patterns, not from innate ability. These stereotypes persist because of media representation, unequal opportunities, and social expectations.

When cultural biases are removed, men and women show nearly identical preferences and abilities across cognitive, emotional, and social domains.
