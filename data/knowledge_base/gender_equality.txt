Gender equality, also known as sexual equality or equality of the sexes, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender. It includes economic participation and decision-making, and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations, and needs equally, regardless of gender.

The Global Gender Gap Index was first introduced by the World Economic Forum to measure gender-based gaps in access to resources and opportunities. As of recent assessments, progress toward gender equality varies by region and domain, but the evidence is clear: gender equality benefits everyone.

Training for gender equality and women's empowerment is essential for creating inclusive societies. This includes education, workplace policies, legal frameworks, and cultural change. Gender equality is not about making everyone the same, but about ensuring that gender does not limit anyone's opportunities or potential.

Equality and universal potential mean recognizing that every individual, regardless of gender, has the right to pursue their interests, develop their talents, and contribute to society. When we remove gender-based barriers, we unlock human potential and create more just, prosperous, and innovative communities.
